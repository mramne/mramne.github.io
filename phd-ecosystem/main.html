    <h4>üêù Welcome to the PhD Ecosystem! üêù</h4>
    <p>This is a resource created by DrGENIE to provide an overview of the support system surrounding doctoral students at Chalmers.</p>
    How to interpret the resource:
    <ul>
        <li>In the inner circle (magenta), immediately surrounding the PhD student (yellow), we have the roles a PhD student is expected to have closest contact with during their years at Chalmers.</li>
        <li>In the outer circle (lighter magenta), we find additional resources available to a PhD student if (or should we say when‚Ä¶) their PhD journey takes an unexpected turn.</li>
        <li>Outside of the honeycomb we find a few additional resources (lavender) that do not have any formal responsibilities toward the PhD student, but may still provide support in times of need and channels for PhD students to influence their work environment.</li>
        <li>Click on any title to learn more about their role in your PhD journey.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Do you know who the person behind each role is in your personal ecosystem?</p>
    <p>Note! We have tried to reflect the overarching structure of the support system surrounding a PhD student, but some variation may occur between departments.</p>
